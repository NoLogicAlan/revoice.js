# Revoice.js - A Voice Module for Revolt

This package is still in developement and lacks many features.

You still are able to play sound to a voice channel. Other features like channel info will follow.

**TODO**:

- [ ] Play/Pause for the media class (help apreciated ;)) [ Kinda implemented already ]
- [ ] Non-voice events like UserJoined and roominfo
- [ ] Audio reception
- [ ] Error Handling; Right now, you have to take care of things like stopping the music if you start to play another song while one is playing

*Disclamer: I might have forgotten some things on the list and thus it might be extended. Fell free to open issues to suggest new features :)*

## Installation

This package uses ffmpeg as base so you'll have to install it properly [from the official site](https://ffmpeg.org/).  
After that, just execute `npm install revoice.js` to install the package, have fun! :)

## Usage

TLDR; You initiate a client, you join a voice channel and then you play media.

Media has to be created using the Media class. You can stream both node streams and media files to revolt.

Example:

```JavaScript
const { Revoice, Media } = require("revoice.js");

const revoice = new Revoice("the-token-of-your-bot");
revoice.join("the-voice-channel-id");
revoice.on("join", () => {
  const media = new MediaPlayer();
  media.playFile("./assets/some-nice-song.mp3");
  // or something like the following:
  media.playStream(fs.createReadStream("./assets/some-nice-song.mp3"));
  revoice.play(media); // playing audio does only work after the the bot joined the voice channel

  // ... pause it
  media.pause();

  // ... resume it later
  media.resume();
});
```
